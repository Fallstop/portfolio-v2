This is a system where via multiple methods, a [client connects](https://mass-rickroll.host.qrl.nz/active) to a remote server where [anyone can trigger an event](http://mass-rickroll.host.qrl.nz/rick) to rickroll everyone connected simultaneously.

## The Core Infrastructure

A script runs on the computer, and connects to a websocket running on the server, and just waits in the background for the rick event, where it opens a browser to the [classic rick roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). It stays in the background, continuing to serve events until the computer shutdown or the program is manually quit. It was decided against to include persistance, as that could easily make a messy situation.

## The Carriers

There was multiple methods of getting the script downloaded and run, but most of the time it was done by two different forms of a bad usb.

### Beetle Arduino (Budget Bad USB)
This is just a normal arduino, except most of the board area is the male USB A connector, and it can emulate keyboards very well. This means it connects, installs its drivers, then opens the run prompt and downloads the script like any other Bad USB.

### An Actual Bad USB
We also got it working on an actual Bad USB which runs ducky script. This one doesn't need to install drivers, making it a lot more powerful and discrete.
