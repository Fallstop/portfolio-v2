### What is Toi?
Toi is an application that allows people to easily search COVID-19 locations of interest between the specified dates. The website has a large easy to navigate map and a slider at the bottom of the webpage to slide through all the different dates and see what the locations of interest were.

### How do I use Toi?
To use Toi you must first navigate to the map. At the bottom of the screen, there is a large slider with this slider you can adjust the two points to select your range of dates. The first point is the starting date and the second is the ending. After this blimps will appear on the map showcasing the locations of interest. You can also filter to only a specific location by using the search box at the top of your screen.
