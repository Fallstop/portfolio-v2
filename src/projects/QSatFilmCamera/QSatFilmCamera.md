## What is PSat?
PSat is a summer program run by the Auckland Program for Space Systems (APSS) at the University of Auckland. The program is designed to give students hands-on experience in building and launching a small "pico-satellite" payload. The payload can be anything the students like, as long as it's self-contained, and fits into the I class rockets, [Sudden Rush](https://locprecision.com/products/sudden-rush) , provided by APSS.

Many teams are formed, which are filtered down through design reviews and checkpoints to a final few teams that get launched at the end of the program. The design reviews are loosely based on a simpler version of NASA's mission lifecycle.

This year, the teams were provided with the following goal:
> ### Create a superlative PSat.
> Your PSat must be the best at something. It can be the fastest, the most powerful, the most efficient, or the most fun.
