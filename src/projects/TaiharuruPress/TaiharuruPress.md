## Framework

The site used Gatsby, and Remark for the CMS (Much like the site you are looking at now). This is the ideal combo for a mostly static website, with the bonus of being able to be deployed for free to a CDN like cloudflare.

## Development Time

The entire site took around about one day of work, from go ahead to finish, ending up with a fair bit of polish.

## Design

The whole thing is a modified version of [gatsby-starter-morning-dew](https://github.com/maxpou/gatsby-starter-morning-dew), it is a very nice template but I had to convert it from a blog to a Book catalog.
