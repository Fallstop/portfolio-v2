Every year, there is a data science competition called GovHack. GovHack is all about taking open government data in the form of obscure spreadsheets and esoteric documents and using that data to build something useful for the public. It's a Hackathon, meaning teams only have 48 hours to build and film a proposal. For my fifth year competing in 2022, my team built, filmed, and released DirtyWatts.nz, a live breakdown of New Zealand's power grid. It has a dashboard breaking down the sources of electricity, showing if the power was coming from Hydro, Gas, Coal, etc. It also included a map of New Zealand, showing all the points where power as flowing in and out of the gird backbone.
