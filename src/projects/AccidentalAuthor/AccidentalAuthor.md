# The first book
#### [E: EEEE EEE EEEEEEEEEEEEE EE](https://www.amazon.com/EEEE-EEE-EEEEEEEEEEEEE-Holy-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-ebook/dp/B0957FFRD1/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1621899876&refinements=p_27%3AEEE+EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE+EEE&s=digital-text&sr=1-1&text=EEE+EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE+EEE)

So, it turns out the bar to self-publish an E-Book and paperback on Amazon is low. Really low. So low that me, a person with no ability to <del>wrote</del> **write**, nor speak for that matter, managed to publish a [391 page book](https://www.amazon.com/EEEE-EEE-EEEEEEEEEEEEE-Holy-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-ebook/dp/B0957FFRD1/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=). The only caveat, is that it was only the letter 'E'.

Watch out, here's a spoiler:
```
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
```

But fun an all, but then I managed to pull ***C O M E D Y*** for reddit, where the collective posts received upwards of 45 thousand upvotes. This meant two things:

 1. I increased my Internet Points
 2. People actually *purchased the book*, which is an interesting financial decision on their part.

 So yeah, I'm now a "successful" self-published author, noice.
 
 # The second book
 #### [E-Bible: Ee eee eeeeeeeee Eee eeeeeee eee eeeeeee eee eee](https://www.amazon.com/Bible-eee-eeeeeeeee-Eee-eeeeeee-ebook/dp/B095MKDT39/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

Once you start you can't stop, I mostly made this one because I wanted a book with more substance to give to my friends as a gag gift. Instead of just straight E, it's a bible made out of E's, made and formatted using Regex.
